<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Hi there! So you are just starting with Rails? That's great!
  And then this place is for you. It summarizes some of the most important
  information about Ruby on Rails for your reference.
  Those things that you tend to forget
  especially in the beginning like: <em>How do I start the server?</em>
  and <em>What was that config directory for again?</em>.
  Furthermore it is directly aimed at beginners so contrary to common
  concise cheat sheets it contains rather verbose descriptions of some
  concepts. I think it can be of help for all people who just
  started with Ruby and Rails, no matter if they are experienced software
  developers or total beginners. Although it is mainly aimed at the latter
  group :-)
</p>
<p>
  A word of warning: This is the first release of this cheat sheet
  so it <em>may contain inaccuracies or even faults.</em> However accuracy
  isn't the first concern of this cheat sheet. Simplicity is. I want to
  help people get started with Ruby and Rails, not confuse them with every
  edge case you can think of.
</p>
<p>
  This is not meant to be a complete guide to Ruby on Rails. If you are
  looking for more information, I keep a list of good resources for
  learning Ruby and Rails (among other things)
  <a href="http://pragtob.wordpress.com/resources/">at my blog.</a>
</p>

<h1>Is there a PDF?</h1>
<p>Yes <a href="http://www.thetomharrison.com/">Tom</a> created a 
repeatable process to create PDFs of this cheat sheet, yay! You can check
out the PDF <strong><a href="RailsBeginnerCheatSheet.pdf">here</a>
</strong>. <a href="http://www.carolineartz.me/">Caroline</a> built a <strong><a href="RailsBeginnerCheatSheetSinglePage.pdf">single page version with links</a></strong>! I suggest you check both of them out and see which one you like better! However, the first is more up to date.</p>

<h1>Issues/Contributing</h1>

<h2>Creator and Maintainer</h2>
<p>
  This cheat sheet is proudly brought to you by Tobias Pfeiffer. However
  please call me Tobi and on the Internet I'm mostly known as
  <em>PragTob</em>. I originally built this for my
  <a href="http://railsgirlsberlin.de/">Rails Girls Berlin</a> project
  group, but I believe a lot of people getting into Rails can benefit from
  it.
